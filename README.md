# CNN_Image_Classifier
This is a convolutional neural network (CNN) image classifier that uses deep learning techniques to classify images. 

#### Project Title: CNN Image Classifier

Project Description: This is a convolutional neural network (CNN) image classifier that uses deep learning techniques to classify images. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, and can accurately predict the class of an image it has never seen before. The model architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers that perform the classification. The project includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. The dataset used for training and testing can be easily customized to suit your needs.


This project can be a great starting point for anyone interested in learning about CNNs and image classification, and can be easily extended to handle more complex datasets and classification tasks.
